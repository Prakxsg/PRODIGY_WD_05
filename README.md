# Weather Web Page

This project is a simple web page that fetches weather data from a weather API based on the user's location or a user-inputted location. It displays the current weather conditions, temperature, and other relevant information.

## Features

- **Location Input**: Users can enter a location (e.g., city name) in an input field.
- **Fetch Weather Data**: When the user clicks the "Get Weather" button, the web page fetches weather data from a weather API based on the entered location.
- **Display Weather Information**: The web page displays the current weather conditions, temperature, description, humidity, and wind speed for the specified location.
- **Error Handling**: If there is an error fetching weather data from the API, the web page displays an error message to the user.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the weather web page.
3. Enter a location in the input field (e.g., city name) and click the "Get Weather" button to fetch weather data for that location.
4. View the displayed weather information on the web page.

## Configuration

- **API Key**: Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` in the `script.js` file with your own API key from a weather API provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
- **API URL**: Modify the API URL in the `script.js` file if you are using a different weather API provider or need to adjust the endpoint URL.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the weather web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file containing the styles for the web page layout and design.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the functionality for fetching weather data and updating the web page with the retrieved information.
